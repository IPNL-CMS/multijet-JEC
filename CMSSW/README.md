# CMSSW component

This directory contains a subpackage for CMSSW to produce custom ROOT files from MiniAOD samples. It depends on the [PEC-tuples](https://github.com/andrey-popov/PEC-tuples) package, version 3.5.0. Many of the plugins used here are provided by PEC-tuples, and it also specifies the version of CMSSW to be used.

Installation instructions are provided in the dedicated [wiki page](https://github.com/andrey-popov/multijet-jec/wiki/Install).
